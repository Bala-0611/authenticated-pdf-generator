 #🛡️ Authenticated PDF Generator - A secure Node.js + Express API for generating PDFs with authentication. Users login via /login route using a predefined username and password (admin / 1234 ) to receive a JWT token. This token is then used in the Authorization header as Bearer <token> to access the protected /generate-pdf route. The endpoint takes a content field from the JSON request body and returns a downloadable PDF file generated using pdfkit. To run the project: clone the repo, move into the folder (cd authenticated-pdf-generator), install dependencies (npm install), and start the server (npm start). Tech used: Node.js, Express, jsonwebtoken, pdfkit. All responses are properly secured, and error handling is included. Perfect for any secure document generation workflow! 🔐📄
